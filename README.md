# 3D Web Game with Earth Portal

A WebGL-based 3D game application that features an immersive Earth visualization portal leading to an interactive gaming environment.

## Overview

This web application creates an engaging user experience by replicating a Google Earth-like interface that transitions into a gaming world. Players begin with an interactive Earth view, zoom in to enter the game, and can explore a 3D environment with their character before entering a portal that leads to the game lobby.
